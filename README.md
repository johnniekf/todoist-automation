<h3>ToDoist Youtube tracker</h3>
<p>
  Simple python script using Google and Todoist API's to take a list of Youtube channel ID's from a Google Sheet and checked for videos uploaded in a 24hr timeframe then hyperlink any new videos as individual tasks on ToDoist labeled by the content creator.
<br><br>
  This project was made due to me occasionally wanting to closely follow certain content creator's series on a more direct basis due to Youtube's algorithm not always showing me new uploads by certain users.<br><br>
  This project can also be expanded to add filters for certain keywords in video titles (I.e. "Series X Ep:") to filter the content even more.
