<h3>ToDoist Automation - Python</h3>
<p>
  This is a project to get used to using API's, and solve an issue I have with ToDoist/Youtube.

  There are Youtubers I want to watch more in certain times (i.e. someone has a cool project that is ongoing that I don't want to miss in my subscription box that's gathered over 10+ years of use)
  So, where better to get notified than within my ToDo app? This script aims to take Youtubers I've listed and add their latest uploads with hyperlinks to my tasks for the day, overtime I plan to update this to make it more user friendly (add usernamers through todoist to get pulled and add tasks at time of upload using subhub)
